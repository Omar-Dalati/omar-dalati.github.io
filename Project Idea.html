			<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			<p><b>Overview:</b>
				My project idea is that I want to create an app/website where you'll pay for your subscription services,
				such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. Directly through my service carrier so that it reflects as one
				payment, not multiple payments, and all charges are aligned on the same day. Choose the subscription
				service you desire and add it to your account to be billed each month, and you can choose any service as
				you please. You will be able to manage all your subscriptions in one place.
			</p>
			<p><b>Motivation:</b> I am motivated by this project idea because I don't particularly appreciate having my
				subscriptions taken out every month at different times, and they are all separate invoices. So, we see
				this continuous build-up with services being charged monthly on bank statements. It isn't enjoyable! I
				want to create a service where all your subscriptions are captured within one payment at your billing
				date. It will ensure that you'll no longer have to encounter any more separate charges. </p>
			<p><b>Description: </b> My product/service is a subscription service where you can freely choose to add any
				of
				the subscriptions you use, whether that varies from having Netflix, Amazon, Crunchyroll, Stan, Disney+,
				or Spotify. See how I'm just listing and listing all these subscription-based services, and it's already
				getting quite annoying; I've just listed six services, which all have separate monthly charges and which
				get billed onto your bank account five times every month. You see that notification pop off on your
				phone. It gets annoying to manage, and what if you stop using one of those services? You'll log onto the
				provider's website and unsubscribe separately, one by one. Is it a nuisance to even consider having to
				do this right? So, what it is, I will create a service where you can manage all your subscriptions
				directly through your phone through our app and or our website. We will support whatever you use to the
				best of our ability. It is a straightforward system; you'll be able to search for the product you want
				to subscribe to, and you'll receive an invoice for your payments. </p>

			<p>
				If you subscribe mid-month of your monthly cycle what will happen is, you'll be able to see how many
				days to go until your payment date. You'll only be required to pay the days counting to you when payment
				is required. So, you will not be paying anything extra for your bill, and then you'll have your payments
				lined up.

			</p>
			<p>This service will be straightforward and accessible. Still, on a web browser which is a one-to-one copy,
				there are no differences or disadvantages to using the web browser. Using it on your phone is easier,
				but we want to ensure it is accessible to all!

				You'll be able to merge your existing accounts as we don't want you missing on your saved shows, it will
				automatically connect once your payment has gone through, and you'll be prompted to link up your account
				with your chosen subscription service!
				You won't be able to watch any services on our platform. The reasoning is that we are purely a
				subscription service for you to use the services, but all payments are directed through us.
			</p>
			</p>

			<p><b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Tools and Technologies:
				For us to create the website, we would need to have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and as well as require a
				payment portal system that will directly work with all subscription services.

				To perform the subscription model, we would need hardware to create our website, so we would need
				laptops/desktops (depending on who is programming the application). We would need to host our servers or
				contact a service provider to host our websites to have users connect to the website.
			<p>
				To create our application to use on iOS and Android devices, we would
				have our app programmed within Swift and Object C, and for Android, we will be
				using Java. Both applications will be the same only difference being the
				programming language. No device will have an advantage/disadvantage on the
				operating system that your device runs.
			</p>
			</p>

			<p><b>Skills Required: </b>
				The first skill that is required and the most essential skill to create my project idea is to create a
				mock-up of the design how the app and website will look like. Then we would implement

				The skills required for the project are being able to develop an app. Coding with using Swift, Object C
				for iOS, and Java for Android. The website will need to be written up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
				Hardware won't be over the top. We will just need to have a laptop/desktop that can program with no
				issues, and a higher-end specification laptop will assist with programming.

			<p> I can take this within two options I can learn how to program myself through an app development course
				as the programming language that I have chosen is Object C and Swift for iOS and Java for Android. I can
				study these programming languages via RMIT Online, it is a short course.

				The second option with my project idea requires for myself to hire developers to code both the software
				and web browser version of both products. Front-end Developers to create the base of our website, we
				require a User Interface Designers to design both the application and website. And a back-end Developers
				to manage the server to user connection, the customers log in information, user encryption, user
				security.
			</p>
			</p>
			<p><b>Drawbacks: </b> The biggest drawback isnâ€™t the programming or the development of the project, but it is the licensing of said subscriptions, we would need to come into agreement with companies in order to set up our subscription service. If we do not have enough services, the project idea will fail. </p>
			<p><b>Outcome: </b>
				If the project is successful, consumers can use our subscription service and manage their services
				directly through our application. The original problem is resolved. The development is that people do
				not have numerous payments from their bank accounts. It will be shown as one single invoice.
