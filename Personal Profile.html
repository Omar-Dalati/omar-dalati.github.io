			<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b> After analysing the information regarding my test
				about myself I have noticed that there's a correlation between only two of them, the results of the
				Myers-Briggs personality test have determined that I am INFJ-T which stands for Introverted, Intuitive,
				Feeling and Judging. I am someone who thinks with their emotions more so than a logical perspective,
				however this doesn't mean I won't think logically whatsoever. I am principled and work within a manner
				of where I need to have a concise set of plans before I can get working, even though at the same time I
				am someone who is very hands on and loves to learn as they go which in my second test that I have chosen
				was Education Planner, the result that came from Education Planner was that I am someone who learns
				hands on, I learn when I am doing something, for example while creating my website, I code whatever I
				think looks the best to myself, and I continued to do so, however I still had a set layout within the
				back of my mind and worked on that basis before jumping in directly. <br> Honey and Mumford test stated
				I am a reflector which they reflect and prefer to stand back and observe before jumping into it. These
				are now two very different results from firstly me being hands on to now being reluctant and staying
				back. The truth is that I am someone who enjoys working with information that I have gathered prior and
				then going into whatever, it is I am going into, and I won't let myself stop. </p>
			<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b>What is it that may
				influence the team is that I am someone who likes to work alone, as you can see, I am introverted
				however if I am able to where I do have to work with others I don't mind. I am someone whom enjoys
				having a set out plan of the work prior to jumping into the work directly and planning out a scenario of
				how we will work together as a team and now in a team setting I want to make sure all of us are on the
				same boat and I know sometimes we won't be but that's absolutely </p>
			<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> The best way taking this into account is that I am someone whom is quite hands on within the group,
					for example I like being a leader but at the same time I like being designated a position / role and
					told what to do, however what we and my team can do as an example is determine everyone's strengths
					and weaknesses and for everyone within their results and which could assist us to see how we learn
					and think and work. </p>
