			<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
				After analysing the information regarding my test about myself, I noticed a correlation between only two
				of them. The results of the Myers-Briggs personality test have determined that I am INFJ-T which stands
				for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging. I am someone who thinks with my emotions more so than a
				logical perspective. However, this doesn't mean I won't believe logically whatsoever. I am principled
				and work in a manner where I need to have a concise set of plans before I can get working, even though,
				at the same time I'm a hands-on and enjoy learning as I go, which in the second test I chose was
				Education Planner. The
				result that came from Education Planner was that I am someone who learns hands-on. While creating my
				website for this assignment, I enjoyed coding with what looked the best to me, and I continued to do so.
				However, I still had a set layout within the back of my mind and worked on that basis before jumping in
				directly.
			<p>
				Honey and Mumford's test stated that I am a reflector, and reflectors prefer to stand back and observe
				before jumping into it. These are now two very different results from firstly me being hands-on to now
				being reluctant and staying around. The truth is that I enjoy working with the information that I find,
				then with the information that I have gathered I start the project.
			</p>
			</p>
			<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b> The results may influence
				the behaviour of the team in that I am someone who likes to work alone. As you can see, I am
				introverted; however, where I do have to work with others, I will do so and participate. I am someone
				who enjoys having a set-out plan of the work before jumping into the work directly and planning out a
				scenario of how we will work together as a team, and now in a team setting, I want to make sure all of
				us are on the same boat, and I know sometimes we won't be, but that's fine as we can step back and plan
				out a workaround in the instance this does occur. This is how my results may influence my behaviour in a
				team. </p>
			<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> The best way to consider this is that I
				prefer being hands-on when working with a team. For example, I like being a leader, but at the same
				time, I like being designated a position/role and told what to do. However, what my team and I can do as
				an example is determine everyone's strengths and weaknesses and for everyone within their results, which
				could assist us in seeing how we learn and think and work. </p>
