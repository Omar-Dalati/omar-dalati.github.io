		<h1><u>Ideal Job</u></h1>

		<p><b> A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you </b>Originally, I wanted to become a teacher at a primary school, I had one specific teacher in primary school he was my IT Teacher, and he was the one whom had got me into technology essentially and I genuinely do thank him for that. As I grew up, I told people I wanted to become an IT Teacher, and everyone discouraged me from doing so as they stated I wouldn't be a good fit. However, I took their words with a grain of salt. Now that being said this position isn’t a teaching job at all however it is a position that manages the School’s ICT Environment from Wi-Fi to the VOIP Telephony, security and the CCTV System. They do everything in relation to IT within the school. This is a grain of what the position entails. But to able to work for the staff and to assist students with any desktop/server/network/application issues is what makes me happy. I love being able to fix things and support others when they're in need of my help. </p>
		<p><b>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</b> I don't have experience within the work field; however, I've worked with servers and hardware at my prior studies, coded in Java also during my studies at Chisholm Institute completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology</p>
		<p><b>Outline your IT experience?</b> I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology, which I had completed at Chisholm Institute in 2019, and the amount of knowledge I had gained during my time there was amazing, 
        unfortunately it is now 2022 and I've forgotten most of it but hoping the course jogs my memory. And I also had previously studied with Swinburne University, Bachelors of ICT, however I stopped my studies to work full time, so I only roughly completed a years' worth of university.</p>
        <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b> Honestly the way I'm planning on being able to get be able gain the qualifications and experience for the position, is completed Bachelor of Information Technology and attempting to get an internship within a helpdesk job while studying!</p>
