			<h1><u>Ideal Job</u></h1>

			<p><b> A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you
				</b>
				Initially, I wanted to become a teacher at a primary school. I had one specific teacher in primary
				school who was my IT Teacher, and he was the one who got me interested in everything to do with
				technology. I genuinely do thank him for that. As I grew up, I told people I wanted to become an IT
				Teacher, and everyone discouraged me from doing so as they stated I wouldn't be a good fit. However, I
				took their words with a grain of salt. Now that being said, this position isn't a teaching job at all;
				however, it is a position that manages the School's ICT Environment, from Wi-Fi to the VOIP Telephony,
				security and the CCTV System. They do everything concerning IT within the school. It is what the
				position entails. But to be able to work for the staff and to assist students with any
				desktop/server/network/application issues is what makes me happy. I love being able to fix things and
				support others when they require my help. </p>
			<p><b>
					A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
				</b>
				They require to have previous experience as a technical support engineer, an IT Help Desk type role, The
				ability to work with Microsoft servers, VMware, and Networking knowledge. There is no requirement for
				any studies; however, they want previous experience.
				They require previous work experience that ranges from Technical Support Engineer, Desktop Support
				Engineer, IT Help Desk Technician or similar role. There aren't any necessary qualifications for the
				position. However, the school requires previous work experience working with Microsoft Servers, services
				such as Active Directory DHCP, and DNS. They have demonstrated expertise in VMware or comparable
				virtualisation solutions, supporting and administering Windows and Apple Devices, working knowledge of
				VLANs and IP routing, Google apps suite administration, and experience with compass and School
				management systems. Understanding of audio-visual technologies. These are the technical requirements for
				the job. VLANs allow the students and teachers to have a direct network everywhere within the school
				network to manage security policies, internet traffic, and especially administration.
				<br>
				They also require someone to be able to explain technical situations to a non-technical audience,
				someone with excellent listening skills and time management, and they want someone who understands the
				college's needs and suggestions for improvements.
			</p>
			<p><b>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</b> My current
				qualification is that I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology, in which I gained the skills to
				work with servers directly, experience using VMware and set up VLAN networks and IP Routing. I also have
				personal knowledge of working with Windows computers and apple devices such as iPhones, iMacs, MacBooks,
				and iPads. I have personal experience setting up my home cameras and routing the ethernet cables to the
				direct camera control system. However, I do not have any direct work experience in these areas. </p>
			<p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the
					position.</b> How I will obtain the further required skills by finishing off my Bachelor of
				Information Technology, in which I plan to find an internship to develop my skills and gain the
				necessary skills required. And studying my time on Python. </p>
