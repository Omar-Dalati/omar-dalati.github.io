		<h1><u>Ideal Job</u></h1>

		<p><b> A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. </b>Originally, I wanted to become a teacher at a primary school, I had one specific teacher in primary school he was my IT Teacher, and he was the one whom had got me into technology essentially and I genuinely do thank him for that. As I grew up, I told people I wanted to become an IT Teacher, and everyone discouraged me from doing so as they stated I wouldn't be a good fit. However, I took their words with a grain of salt. Now that being said this position isn't a teaching job at all however it is a position that manages the School's ICT Environment from Wi-Fi to the VOIP Telephony, security and the CCTV System. They do everything in relation to IT within the school. This is a grain of what the position entails. But to able to work for the staff and to assist students with any desktop/server/network/application issues is what makes me happy. I love being able to fix things and support others when they're in need of my help. </p>
		<p><b>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</b> I don't have experience within the work field; however, I've worked with servers and hardware at my prior studies, coded in Java also during my studies at Chisholm Institute completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology</p>
		<p><b>Outline your IT experience?</b> I don't have experience within the work field; however, I've worked with servers and hardware at my prior studies, coded in Java also during my studies at Chisholm Institute completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology. I genuinely donâ€™t think that the qualifications that I currently have / lack of work experience will prevent myself from attaining a position. I'm very passionate about what it is that I want to do, I have a lot of personal experience within working with Servers, CCTV, Computers. The main concern is the things I do not have experience within which is where my course will take into assistance </p>
        <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b> The way I'm planning on being able to get be able gain the qualifications and experience for the position, is completed Bachelor of Information Technology ideologically what else would work out is to be able to find an internship position at a school in order to able to gain the necessary experience</p>
