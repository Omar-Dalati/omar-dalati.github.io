			<h1>Personal Information</h1>
			<p>My name's Omar Dalati, and I am 21 years old. I was born in Australia. However, my parents were born in
				Lebanon, Beirut (Unfortunately, my Arabic is quite broken). My highest education is a Certificate IV in
				Information Technology, which I completed at Chisholm Institute in 2019. My hobbies include video games,
				League of Legends and World of Warcraft, and the occasional single-player game and watching
				anime/reading manga! Here is a photo of me!</p>

			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b> My interest in IT is many things that branch from
				programming, Networking, video games, and tech. Creating something from nothing is quite
				challenging, but at the same time, it is so rewarding. That's why I've taken such interest in
				programming itself. Networking is exciting more than anything. Understanding how servers work is
				something I desire to learn (I had dabbled in Networking in my Certificate IV in IT, but it's been quite
				some time now.) </p>
			<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b> Honestly, when I was a child, I learnt how to build computers
				all from scratch at a young age, and ever since then, I've been my
				family and friends' technology guru, and they always reach out to me for assistance.</p>
			<p><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b>? Yeah! I had an instance in
				primary school! My IT Teacher had asked me if I was interested in building / experimenting with the
				computers at school, and I said yes. But it was daunting at first going into building a computer, but I
				had guidance, and all I remember is it being fun. It was my earliest memory of experiencing technology,
				and never looked back since.</p>
			<p><b>Outline your IT experience?</b> I have a Certificate IV in Information Technology, which I completed
				at Chisholm Institute in 2019, and the amount of knowledge I gained during my time there was incredible.
				Unfortunately, it is 2022, and I've forgotten most of it, but I hope this course jogs my memory. And I
				also had previously studied with Swinburne University for a Bachelor of ICT, however, I stopped my
				studies from working full time, so I only roughly completed a year's worth of university.</p>
			<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b> My co-worker had told me about Open University. I had never
				heard of them before, and the amount of information Open University provided me about the course is what
				sparked my interest again. My guidance from the OUA Team was excellent, and I was very interested in
				starting! </p>
			<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b> I hope to learn from my studies to gain the
				knowledge to strive for a career in programming, specifically Networking. But this doesn't come directly
				from the university from themselves, and I must put in the hard work and commit my time to my studies to
				be able to learn. I am excited to start Introduction to Programming in the future. This is one of my pathways that i desire, my other desired path way is to become a IT support officer at a school to where they are the backbone for anything that is related to IT. 
				well.</p>
